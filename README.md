# CQM-Project
This repository is dedicated to the final project for the "Computational Quanum Mechanics" course taken as part of my MSc in Computational Physics.
It contains the files of the code written for the purposes of the project (main and functions used) as well as the final project presentation in pdf form.

The aim of the project was to study the behavior of Shannon entropy for elements with atomic numbers  2≥Z≥10.
